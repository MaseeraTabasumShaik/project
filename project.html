    <p>Sudha Murty is an Indian educator,author and the philanthropist who is chairperson of Infosys Foundations.She is married to the cofounder of Infosys N. R. Narayana Murthy.Murty was awarded the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India,for the social work by the Government of India in 2006.Later in 2023, she was awarded the PadmaBhushan,the third highest civilian award in India.Sudha Murty began her professional career in computer science and engineering.She is the chairperson of the Infosys Foundation and a member of the public health care initiatives of the Gates Foundation. She has founded several orphanages, participated in the rural development efforts, supported the movement to provide Karnataka government schools with computer and library facilities, and established Murty Classical Library of India at Harvard University.Sudha Murthy has also acted in the film as well as a Kannada film Prarthana.Sudha Murty was born into a Kannada-speaking Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family on 19 August 1951 in Shiggaon, Haveri in Karnataka, India, the daughter of R. H. Kulkarni, a surgeon, and his wife Vimala Kulkarni , a school teacher. She was raised by her parents and maternal grandparents. These childhood experiences form the historical basis for her first notable work entitled How I Taught My Grandmother to Read, Wise and  Otherwise and Other Stories.[17] Murty completed a B.Eng. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the B.V.B. College of Engineering & Technology (now known as KLE Technological University), and then a M.Eng. in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Science.</p>
    <p> She has been a prolific and celebrated writer too. As an author Sudha Murthy reflects considerable diversity. Her writings include novels, short stories, travelogues, technical books, and memoirs. Her books have been translated in several Indian languages.Some of famous books of Sudha Murthy are The Mother I Never Knew, How I Taught My Grandmother to Read and Other Stories, Three Thousand Stitches, The Man from the Egg, Dollar Bahu, Wise and Otherwise among others.Dollar Bahu was originally written by her in Kannada and later translated into English as Dollar Bahu. The popularity of the book induced it to be adapted into a television series, which was aired on Zee TV in 2001. The story beautifully expresses the inherent craze for the affluent life in the US of an aspirational Indian mother-in-law and also how economics govern the family structure and values. This book is however not the story of one family but effectively mirrors the trend among many aspirational Indian middle-class families too. Her another book titled Three Thousand Stiches is very inspirational. It comprises 11 short stories, drawn from the personal life experiences of Sudha Murthy and from her experiences as the Chairperson of Infosys Foundation. Sudha Murthy has infused a message in each of these stories. The main story of the book on which the title of the book is named is centered around the live of the temple sex workers or devadasis, and depicts the author’s determination to make them self-sustainable and removing the dishonor that was attached to them. The story revolves around rescue and rehabilitation of 3,000 devdasis in Karnataka and the problems that Sudha Murthy encountered while doing so; including having chappals and tomatoes thrown at her. Eventually the Herculean efforts of Sudha Murthy resulted in making Karnataka free of the bad custom of temple prostitutes or devdasis.Another of the story in the book, which talks about her gynecologist father’s first delivery (A Life Unwritten) is also quite moving. Another story explores her experiences of being the only girl studying engineering in a boy’s college which didn’t have even a women’s toilet (How to Beat The Boys).Another of the popular book written by Sudha Murthy is titled Wise and Otherwise. It is a compelling non-fiction read where one can find interesting and evocative description of diverse shades of human nature, some of which can startle and make us poignant at the same time. The true stories cover the amazing diversity in human nature from incredible generosity to meanest acts and thus mirror the life itself in its beauty and ugliness.Sudha Murthy won several awards during her illustrious journey as a philanthropist and an author, which includes Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award of India. Sudha Murthy was also the recipient of Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award by Karnataka Government in 2010 for excellence in Kannada literature. It is a prestigious literary award dedicated for woman writers in Karnataka. She also won R.K. Narayan’s Award of Literature, and IIT Kanpur awarded her Honorary degree of Doctor of Science.</p>
